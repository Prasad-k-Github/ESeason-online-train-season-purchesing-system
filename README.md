- **Web Backend**: Node.js
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
- **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging for mobile push notifications
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe or PayPal for secure transactions
- **Security**: Multi-factor authentication (MFA), encryption for data privacy
